1: install the python library uncompyle6
pip3 install uncompyle6

2: verify the type of the file by using
$ file crackme4

You wille se that crackme4 is python bytecode file

3: rename the crackme4 file into crackme4.pyc since theuncompyle6 command only works on .pyc file

4: decompile the file by using
$ uncompyle6 crackme4.pyc

this command will uncompile the crackme4.pyc file and print the result on the stdout

5: you can now read the code and find the password or decompile again but this time by saving 
the result inside in a file called crackme4.py
- open the file and add the the line of code: print(0k) before the test condition
 to see the password

4- execute again the the crackme4.py by using
$ python3 crackme4.py
and execute to see the password
